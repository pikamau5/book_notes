# Code vs Pre-viz
## Code or Pre-viz
* Consider time spent making either
### Pre-visualize
* Learnability
* Representation
* Hierarchy
### Code
* Efficiency

## How to make a previz
### Sketch
* Shitty sketch = more honest feedback
### Paper prototype
* One person "uses" and one changes (miro??)
### Interactive prototype
* some cases more useful - remotely
