# Contextual analysis
Analyzing how the user uses the tool. 
Questions / pointers to tell the user:
## Introduction
* The tool is being evaluated, not the user
* Making mistakes might make it easier to fix problems
## Goals
* Why do you use this tool?
## Master + apprentice
* Ask the user to show how the tool works
## Guiding the discussion
* Features -> goals
* Avoid leading questions
* Ask the user to talk out loud
* Don't help (before the analysis is done)
* Wide -> narrow (?)
## After the analysis
* Prioritized list of people's goals
